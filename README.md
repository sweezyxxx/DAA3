# MST Algorithms Comparison (Prim vs Kruskal)

**Project:** MST Performance Evaluation  
**Student:** **Almukhamedov Temirlan**

This project evaluates and compares two classic Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms: **Prim's Algorithm** and **Kruskal's Algorithm**.  
The evaluation is performed on multiple datasets with different graph sizes to measure and compare:

Total MST cost  
Execution time (average, ms)  
Number of operations (average)

All datasets are stored in JSON format and processed automatically.
